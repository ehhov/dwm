My configuration for the suckless dwm
=====================================
Original: https://dwm.suckless.org/

I have applied patches:
 - pertag
 - focusonclick (modified, follow FHOR in dwm.c)
 - cool autostart
 - systray
 - actualfullscreen
 - focusurgent
 - movestack
 - resetlayout (my variant, follow RESLAY in dwm.c and see resetlayout() 
   in config.h)

Other changes:
 - New make target: entry. You can copy dwm.desktop to 
   /usr/share/xsessions to be able to run it from a Display Manager.
 - A bunch of layouts based on tile(), tilegaps(), deck().
 - tag() function in dwm.c is modified so that its behavior is analogous 
   to view(NULL) (follow TAGNULL in dwm.c).
 - Window title alignment control (follow TIALIGN in dwm.c).


dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
